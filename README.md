# MyKea Ikea Clone

> Over a two-week period, a five-person team of Hack Reactor students made a functioning, full-stack clone of Ikea's product page. Each member of the team created their self-contained component in React, served it using Express and linked it to their individual database, made with either MySQL or MongoDB.
Those components were each deployed using Amazon Web Services and each member of the team created their own proxy server, which was also deployed over Amazon Web Services.
The final product seamlessly integrates the five components, passes client input among components and displays functionality, styling and interactivity identical to Ikea's actual website.
